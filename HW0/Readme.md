# HW 0
The HW0 assignment is solving a second-order differential equation using numerical methods.

The program should only run the Matlab HW0.m script. The script gets the initial values: 

N, the boundary conditions, and the interval [a b]. Then, the script writes the input.txt, compiles and runs the C program that solves the equation.

Then, all the relevant graphs are plotted.

The code not using the Matlab script can be found here: https://github.com/roibaruch24/CFD_086376/commit/84007d75f40ed52559612d460b787416617591ba
