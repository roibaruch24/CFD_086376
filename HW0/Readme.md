# HW 0
The HW0 assignment is solving a second-order differential equation using numerical methods.
The program should only run the Matlab HW0.m script. The script gets the initial values: 
N, the boundary conditions, and the interval [a b]. Then, the script writes the input.txt, compiles and runs the C program that solves the equation.
Then, all the relevant graphs are plotted.
